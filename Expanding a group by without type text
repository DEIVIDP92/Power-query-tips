in the below query steps we are referrencing to a source table and grouping as an example: Product amd Category and then,
referrencing to value.type to grab that prior table instead of hardcoding the value types manually.

option1
= Table. Group(Source, {"Product", "Category"},
{{Details", each_, Value.Type( Source ) }})

option2
in this example (which is different), we drill-down by the column details and 
apply a table combine, this way we create a robust logic to avoid errors.
Table.Combine( #"Grouped Rows"[Details] )
